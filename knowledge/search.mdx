title: Agentic Search
---

When we use an Agent to dynamically search for information at runtime, its called **Agentic Search**. The process of **searching, reasoning and responding** is known as Agentic RAG.

When we add a knowledge base to an Agent, we're essentially giving the model, a tool to search for the information it needs to achieve its task. The Model understands the input message and generates a set of keywords, which are used to call the `search_knowledge_base()` tool.

Because the Agent is searching for the information it needs (at runtime), this pattern is referred to as **Agentic Search** and is becoming popular with Agent builders.
