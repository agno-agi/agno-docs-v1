title: Agentic Search
---

Using an Agent to dynamically search for information at runtime is called **Agentic Search**. The process of **searching, reasoning and responding** is also known as Agentic RAG.

With Agno, when we add a knowledge base to an Agent, we're essentially giving the model a tool to search for the information it needs. The Model generates a set of keywords and calls the `search_knowledge_base()` tool to retrieve the relevant information or few-shot examples.

Because the Agent is searching for the information it needs, this pattern is called **Agentic Search** and is becoming very popular with Agent builders.
