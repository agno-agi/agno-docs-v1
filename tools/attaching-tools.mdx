title: Attaching Tools
description: Learn how to add tools to Agents after they have been created.
---

Tools can be added to Agents post-creation. This gives you the flexibility to add tools to an existing Agent instance after initialization, which is useful for dynamic tool management or when you need to conditionally add tools based on runtime requirements.

## Example

Create your own tool, for example `get_weather`. Then call `add_tool` to attach it to your Agent.

```python add_tool_post_initialization.py
import random

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools import tool


@tool(show_result=True, stop_after_tool_call=True)
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather for a city."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
    weather_conditions = ["sunny", "cloudy", "rainy", "snowy", "windy"]
    random_weather = random.choice(weather_conditions)

    return f"The weather in {city} is {random_weather}."


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response("What can you do?", stream=True)

agent.add_tool(get_weather)

agent.print_response("What is the weather in San Francisco?", stream=True)
```

<Tip>

The `add_tool` method allows you to dynamically extend an Agent's capabilities. This is particularly useful when you want to add tools based on user input or other runtime conditions.
