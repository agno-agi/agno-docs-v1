The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Agents to interact with external systems through a standardized interface. With Agno's MCP integration, you can connect any MCP-compatible service to your Agents.

## Example: Filesystem Agent

Here's a filesystem agent that uses the Filesystem MCP server to explore and analyze files:

```python filesystem_agent.py
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client


async def create_filesystem_agent(session):
    """Create and configure a filesystem agent with MCP tools."""
    # Initialize the MCP toolkit
    mcp_tools = MCPTools(session=session)
    await mcp_tools.initialize()

    # Create an agent with the MCP toolkit
    return Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        tools=[mcp_tools],
        instructions=dedent("""\
            You are a filesystem assistant. Help users explore files and directories.

            - Navigate the filesystem to answer questions
            - Use the list_allowed_directories tool to find directories that you can access
            - Provide clear context about files you examine
            - Use headings to organize your responses
            - Be concise and focus on relevant information\
        """),
        markdown=True,
        show_tool_calls=True,
    )


async def run_agent(message: str) -> None:
    """Run the filesystem agent with the given message."""
    # Initialize the MCP server
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="npx",
        args=[
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent),
        ],
    )

    # Create a client session to connect to the MCP server
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            agent = await create_filesystem_agent(session)

            # Run the agent
            await agent.aprint_response(message, stream=True)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Basic example - exploring project license
    asyncio.run(run_agent("What is the license for this project?"))
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling for MCP server connections and operations.

2. **Resource Cleanup**: Use async context managers to ensure proper cleanup of resources:
```python
async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        # Your agent code here
```

3. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear and specific instructions to your agent:

```python
instructions = """
You are a filesystem assistant. Help users explore files and directories.
- Navigate the filesystem to answer questions
- Use the list_allowed_directories tool to find accessible directories
- Provide clear context about files you examine
- Be concise and focus on relevant information
"""
```

## More Information

- Read the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to learn more about the Model Context Protocol.
- Checkout the Agno [Cookbook](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/tools/mcp) for more examples of Agents that use MCP.
