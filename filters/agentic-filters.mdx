# Agentic Knowledge Filters

Agentic filtering lets the Agent automatically extract filter criteria from your query text, making the experience more natural and interactive.

## How It Works

When you enable agentic filtering (`enable_agentic_knowledge_filters=True`), the Agent analyzes your query and applies filters based on the metadata it detects.

**Example:**
```python
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
    enable_agentic_knowledge_filters=True,
)
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me about Jordan Mitchell's experience and skills with jordan_mitchell as user id and document type cv",
    markdown=True,
)
```

In this example, the Agent will automatically use:
- `user_id = "jordan_mitchell"`
- `document_type = "cv"`

## When to Use Agentic Filtering

- When you want a more conversational, user-friendly experience.
- When users may not know the exact filter syntax.

## Best Practices

- Make your queries descriptive (e.g., include user names, document types, years).
- Use agentic filtering for interactive applications or chatbots.

## Manual vs. Agentic Filtering

| Manual Filtering | Agentic Filtering |
|------------------|------------------|
| Explicit filters in code | Filters inferred from query text |
| Full control | More natural, less code |
| Good for automation | Good for user-facing apps |

## Try It Out!

- Enable `enable_agentic_knowledge_filters=True` on your Agent.
- Ask questions naturally, including filter info in your query.
- See how the Agent narrows down results automatically!
