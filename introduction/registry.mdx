## Register Your Entities

In Agno, Agents, Teams, Workflows, and Apps are collectively referred to as "Entities".
When you run any Agno entity, it is automatically registered and monitored out of the box. This means you can instantly view them, along with their metadata and configuration, in the Agno Registry.

The Registry acts as a unified dashboard where all your Agno Agents, Teams, Workflows and Apps are displayed, giving you full visibility into your operational environment. No additional setup is required.



Start exploring at [app.agno.com/registry](https://app.agno.com/registry).

## Authenticate & Enable Monitoring

### Step 1: Authenticate using CLI or API key

To log agent sessions, you need to authenticate using one of these methods:

**Method A: Log in using your command line interface**
```bash
ag setup
```

**Method B: Log using an API key**

Get your API key from [Agno App](https://app.agno.com/settings) and use it to connect your agents to the Agno Platform.

```bash
export AGNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 2: Enable Monitoring

After authentication, enable monitoring for a particular agent or globally for all agents.

**Method A: For a Specific Agent**
```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

**Method B: Globally via Environment Variable**
```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```

### Step 3: Register Your Entity

Once monitoring is enabled, you can run your agent/team/workflow/app and view it in the registry:

1. Create a file `agent.py` with this sample code:

```python 
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    name="Basic Agent",
    description="You can answer basic questions",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
)

agent.print_response("What is are ai agents?")
```

2. Run your code locally
3. View your agent at [app.agno.com/registry](https://app.agno.com/registry)

4. You can also check your agent configuration

### Applications
You can register any application simply by running it â€” it will be monitored and visible on the platform automatically where you can view and interact with each component's configuration in detail.

<Note>
Additionally Playground apps can be opened and explored in the Agno Playground.
