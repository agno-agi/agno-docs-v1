## Register Your Entities

In Agno, Agents, Teams, Workflows, and Apps are collectively referred to as Entities.
When you run any of these via the CLI, they are automatically registered and monitored out of the box. This means you can instantly view them — along with their metadata and configuration in the Agno Registry.

The Registry acts as a unified dashboard where all your CLI-executed entities are displayed, giving you full visibility into your operational environment. No additional setup is required.

## Authenticate & Enable Monitoring

### Step 1: Authenticate using CLI or API key

To log agent sessions, you need to authenticate using one of these methods:

**Method A: Log in using your command line interface**
```bash
ag setup
```

**Method B: Log using an API key**

Get your API key from [Agno App](https://app.agno.com/settings) and use it to log agent sessions to your workspace.

```bash
export AGNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 2: Enable Monitoring

After authentication, enable monitoring for a particular agent or globally for all agents.

**Method A: For a Specific Agent**
```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

**Method B: Globally via Environment Variable**
```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```

### Step 3: Registry Your Entity

Once monitoring is enabled, you can run your agent/team/workflow/app and view it in the registry:

1. Create a file `agent.py` with this sample code:

```python 
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.storage.sqlite import SqliteStorage

agent_storage_file: str = "tmp/agents.db"

agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    role="Search the web for information",
    description="You are a web agent that searches the web for information",
    agent_id="web-agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=[
        "Break down the users request into 2-3 different searches.",
        "Always include sources",
    ],
    storage=SqliteStorage(
        table_name="web_agent", db_file=agent_storage_file, auto_upgrade_schema=True
    ),
)
# Example usage
agent.print_response(
    "What is the weather in New York City?", stream=True
)
```

2. Run your code locally
3. View your agent at [app.agno.com/registry](https://app.agno.com/registry)

4. You can also check your agent configuration

### Applications
You can register any application simply by running it via the CLI — it will be monitored and visible on the platform automatically,where you can view and interact with each component's configuration in detail.

<Note>
However, only Playground apps can be opened and explored in the Playground interface.
