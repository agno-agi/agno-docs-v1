sidebarTitle: Introduction
---

Agno is a multi-agent framework that brings you speed, performance and reliability, without sacrificing developer experience. We provide a framework for building agents, a runtime for serving them in production and a powerful UI for managing your agentic system.

Agno Agents come with built-in memory, knowledge and reasoning. They can be orchestrated as autonomous multi-agent teams or deterministic, stateful workflows. To serve your agents, teams and workflows in production, Agno provides a FastAPI-based runtime called the AgentOS, which comes with a beautiful UI that acts as a control plane for your agentic system.

For organizations building agentic systems, Agno provides a complete solution. You get the most advanced framework for building your agentic system, an API for serving it in production and a control plane for managing it. Your also get complete data privacy and control, the AgentOS runs on your infrastructure and no data ever leaves your system.

# Learn the basics

To learn the basics, build your first Agent and run it using the AgentOS.

# Getting Started

If you're new to Agno, learn how to build your [first Agent](/introduction/agents), chat with it on the [playground](/introduction/playground) and [monitor](/introduction/monitoring) it on [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

# Why Agno?

Agno will help you build best-in-class, highly-performant agentic systems, saving you hours of research and boilerplate. Here are some key features that set Agno apart:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno provides a unified interface to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Highly performant**: Agents instantiate in **~3Î¼s** and use **~6.5Kib** memory on average.
- **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Reasoning improves reliability and is a must-have for complex autonomous agents. Agno supports 3 approaches to reasoning: Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `chain-of-thought` approach.
- **Natively Multi-Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi-modal, they accept text, image, audio and video as input and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (**Agent Teams**) with reasoning, memory, and shared context.
- **Built-in Agentic Search**: Agents can search for information at runtime using 20+ vector databases. Agno provides state-of-the-art Agentic RAG, **fully async and highly performant.**
- **Built-in Memory & Session Storage**: Agents come with built-in `Storage` & `Memory` drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Pre-built FastAPI Routes**: After building your Agents, serve them using pre-built FastAPI routes. 0 to production in minutes.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
