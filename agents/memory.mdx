title: Memory
---

If you're building intelligent agents, you need to give them memory **which is their ability to learn about the user they are interacting with**. Memory comes in 3 shapes:

1. **Session Storage:** Session storage saves sessions in a database and enables Agents to have multi-turn conversations. Session storage also holds the session state, which is persisted across runs because it is saved to the database after each run. Session storage is a form of short-term memory **called "Storage" in Agno**.

2. **User Memories:** The Agent can also store insights and facts about the user it learns over time. This helps the agents personalize its response to the user it is interacting with. Think of this as adding "ChatGPT like memory" to your agent. **This is called "Memory" in Agno**.

3. **Session Summaries:** The Agent can store a condensed representations of the session, useful when chat histories gets too long. **This is called "Summary" in Agno**.

Memory helps Agents:
 - Manage session history and state (session storage).
 - Personalize responses to users (user memories).
 - Maintain long-session context (session summaries).

## Default Memory

Every Agent comes with built-in memory that keeps track of the session while the Agent is running.

You can access the messages in this session using `agent.get_messages_for_session()`.

You can give your agent access to chat history in the following ways:

- You can set `add_history_to_messages=True` and `num_history_responses=5` to add the previous 5 messages automatically to every message sent to the agent.
- You can set `read_chat_history=True` to provide a `get_chat_history()` tool to your agent allowing it to read any message in the entire chat history.
- You can set `read_tool_call_history=True` to provide a `get_tool_call_history()` tool to your agent allowing it to read tool calls in reverse chronological order.

  <Step title="Built-in memory example">
    ```python agent_memory.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from rich.pretty import pprint

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        # Set add_history_to_messages=true to add the previous chat history to the messages sent to the Model.
        add_history_to_messages=True,
        # Number of historical responses to add to the messages.
        num_history_responses=3,
        description="You are a helpful assistant that always responds in a polite, upbeat and positive manner.",
    )

    # -*- Create a run
    agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story", stream=True)
    # -*- Print the messages in the memory
    pprint([m.model_dump(include={"role", "content"}) for m in agent.get_messages_for_session()])

    # -*- Ask a follow up question that continues the conversation
    agent.print_response("What was my first message?", stream=True)
    # -*- Print the messages in the memory
    pprint([m.model_dump(include={"role", "content"}) for m in agent.get_messages_for_session()])

## Session Storage

The built-in memory only lasts while the session is active.

To persist history and state across runs, we can provide `AgentStorage` which saves an Agent's session to a database or file. Storage has typically been an under-discussed part of agentic infrastructure, but we see it as one of the most critical pieces of the stack.

While storage is absolutely necessary when building user facing AI products as any production application will need to be able to retrieve sessions, continue sessions, and save state between runs. There is so much more:
- Storage saves our Agent's session data for inspection and evaluations.
- Storage helps us extract few-shot examples from session data, which can be used to improve the Agent.
- Storage enables us to build internal monitoring tools and dashboards.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Storage example">
        Let's test this out, create a file `persistent_memory.py` with the following code:

        ```python persistent_memory.py
        import json

        from rich.console import Console
        from rich.panel import Panel
        from rich.json import JSON

        from agno.agent import Agent
        from agno.models.google.gemini import Gemini
        from agno.storage.sqlite import SqliteStorage

        agent = Agent(
            model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.0-flash-exp"),
            # Store agent sessions in a database
            storage=SqliteStorage(table_name="agent_sessions", db_file="tmp/agent_storage.db"),
            # Set add_history_to_messages=true to add the previous chat history to the messages sent to the Model.
            add_history_to_messages=True,
            # Number of historical responses to add to the messages.
            num_history_responses=3,
            # Description creates a system prompt for the agent
            description="You are a helpful assistant that always responds in a polite, upbeat and positive manner.",
        )

        console = Console()

        def print_chat_history(agent):
            # -*- Print history
            console.print(
                Panel(
                    JSON(json.dumps([m.model_dump(include={"role", "content"}) for m in agent.memory.messages]), indent=4),
                    title=f"Chat History for session_id: {agent.session_id}",
                    expand=True,
                )
            )

        session_id = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"

        # -*- Create a run
        agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story", stream=True, session_id=session_id)
        # -*- Print the chat history
        print_chat_history(agent)

        # -*- Ask a follow up question that continues the conversation
        agent.print_response("What was my first message?", stream=True, session_id=session_id)
        # -*- Print the chat history
        print_chat_history(agent)
        ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install google-genai agno
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python persistent_memory.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


You can view the agent sessions in the sqlite database and continue any conversation by providing the same `session_id`.

## User Memories

Along with storing session history and state, Agents can also create user memories based on the conversation history.

To enable user memories, give your Agent a `Memory` object and set `enable_agentic_memory=True`.

<Note>
Enabling user memory will also add all existing user memories to the agent's system prompt.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="User memory example">
    ```python user_memory.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.memory.v2.db.sqlite import SqliteMemoryDb
    from agno.memory.v2.memory import Memory
    from agno.models.google.gemini import Gemini

    memory_db = SqliteMemoryDb(table_name="memory", db_file="tmp/memory.db")
    memory = Memory(db=memory_db)

    john_doe_id = "john_doe@example.com"

    agent = Agent(
        model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.0-flash-exp"),
        memory=memory,
        enable_agentic_memory=True,
    )

    # The agent can add new memories to the user's memory
    agent.print_response(
        "My name is John Doe and I like to hike in the mountains on weekends.",
        stream=True,
        user_id=john_doe_id,
    )

    agent.print_response("What are my hobbies?", stream=True, user_id=john_doe_id)

    # The agent can also remove all memories from the user's memory
    agent.print_response(
        "Remove all existing memories of me. Completely clear the DB.",
        stream=True,
        user_id=john_doe_id,
    )

    agent.print_response(
        "My name is John Doe and I like to paint.", stream=True, user_id=john_doe_id
    )

    # The agent can remove specific memories from the user's memory
    agent.print_response("Remove any memory of my name.", stream=True, user_id=john_doe_id)

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install google-genai agno
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python user_memory.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

User memories are stored in the `Memory` object and persisted in the `SqliteMemoryDb` to be used across multiple users and multiple sessions.


## Session Summaries

To enable session summaries, set `enable_session_summaries=True` on the `Agent`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Session summary example">
    ```python session_summary.py
        from agno.agent import Agent
        from agno.memory.v2.db.sqlite import SqliteMemoryDb
        from agno.memory.v2.memory import Memory
        from agno.models.google.gemini import Gemini

        memory_db = SqliteMemoryDb(table_name="memory", db_file="tmp/memory.db")
        memory = Memory(db=memory_db)

        user_id = "jon_hamm@example.com"
        session_id = "1001"

        agent = Agent(
            model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.0-flash-exp"),
            memory=memory,
            enable_session_summaries=True,
        )

        agent.print_response(
            "What can you tell me about quantum computing?",
            stream=True,
            user_id=user_id,
            session_id=session_id,
        )

        agent.print_response(
            "I would also like to know about LLMs?",
            stream=True,
            user_id=user_id,
            session_id=session_id
        )

        session_summary = memory.get_session_summary(
            user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id
        )
        print(f"Session summary: {session_summary.summary}\n")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the example">
