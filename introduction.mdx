---

**Agno is a lightweight library for building Multimodal Agents.**

- **Build lightning-fast Agents that take any modality as input** (text, image, audio and video) **and generate any modality as output** (text, image, audio and video)**.**
- **Add memory, knowledge, tools and reasoning as needed.**
- **Run anywhere** (AWS, GCP, Azure, Replit, Modal), **Agno is open-source.**

**Instead of wrapping LLMs, Agno exposes LLMs as a unified API and gives them superpowers.** Here's an Agent that can search the web:

```python websearch_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("What's happening in New York?", stream=True)
```

# Key features

Agno is simple, fast and model agnostic. Here are some key features:

- **Lightning Fast**: Agent creation is 10,000x faster than LangGraph (see [performance](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno#performance)).
- **Model Agnostic**: Use any model, any provider, no lock-in.
- **Multi Modal**: Native support for text, image, audio and video.
- **Multi Agent**: Build teams of specialized agents.
- **Memory Management**: Store agent sessions and state in a database.
- **Knowledge Stores**: Use vector databases for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning.
- **Structured Outputs**: Make Agents respond in a structured format.
- **Monitoring**: Track agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
