Agno is a multi-agent framework for building the Agent OS - a network of agents, teams and workflows, operating as a single unit:

1. **Agents with tools:** Simple agents executing narrowly scoped tasks using tools.
2. **Agents with memory and knowledge:** Agents that access memory and knowledge at runtime to improve response quality.
3. **Agents with memory, knowledge and reasoning:** Agents that reason through complex multi-step problems, accessing memory and knowledge as needed.
4. **Multi-Agent Teams:** Multiple agents collaborating using shared context, memory, and knowledge to achieve a shared goal.
5. **Agentic Workflows:** Deterministic workflows orchestrating multiple agents and teams, sharing state, context and ensuring reliable execution.
6. **Superintelligence:** A network of agents, teams and workflows that can reason, collaborate, achieve complex goals and self-improve.

# Agent OS

To build products with Agents, we need to:
1. Build Agents, Teams and Workflows, with memory, knowledge and reasoning.
2. Deploy them as a system accessible via API.

Agent OS is the system that let's us deploy agents, teams, and workflows as an API. Agno provides the framework to build the Agent OS, and a beautiful UI for managing it.

<Tip>

If like us, you believe that Superintelligence is a system of agents, teams and workflows, operating as a single unit. Then Agent OS is the operating system for this superintelligence.

# Getting Started

- If you're new to Agno, learn about [Agents](/introduction/agents) and how to manage them using the [Agent OS](/introduction/agent-os).
- After that, dive deeper into the [core concepts](/introduction#dive-deeper) or explore the [examples gallery](/examples).
- If you're looking for help, checkout our [community and support](/introduction/community) forums.
