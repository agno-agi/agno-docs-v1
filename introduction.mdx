---

Engineers use Agno to build multi-agent systems spanning the 6 levels of intelligence:

1. **Agents with tools:** Simple agents executing narrowly scoped tasks using tools.
2. **Agents with memory and knowledge:** Agents that dynamically access long-term memory and knowledge at runtime, improving performance and response quality.
3. **Agents with memory, knowledge and reasoning:** Advanced agents capable of reasoning through complex multi-stage problems, searching memory and knowledge as needed.
4. **Multi-Agent Teams:** Multiple agents collaborating using shared context, memory, and knowledge to achieve complex tasks.
5. **Agentic Workflows:** Robust workflows orchestrating multiple agents and teams, maintaining shared state and ensuring reliable, deterministic execution.
6. **Superintelligence:** A system of agents, teams and workflows that can reason, collaborate and achieve complex goals, and even self-improve.

**Level 1 Agent** that uses Reasoning and Yahoo Finance to answer questions about stocks:

```python Reasoning Finance Agent
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions="Use tables to display data.",
    markdown=True,
)
```

# Agent OS

Agent OS is the user interface for superintelligence. It connects directly to your live-running agents, teams and workflows, and allows you to run, monitor and manage them.

# Why Agno?

Agno will help you build best-in-class, highly-performant agentic systems, saving you hours of research and boilerplate. Here are some key features that set Agno apart:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno provides a unified interface to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Highly performant**: Agents instantiate in **~3Î¼s** and use **~6.5Kib** memory on average.
- **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Reasoning improves reliability and is a must-have for complex autonomous agents. Agno supports 3 approaches to reasoning: Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `chain-of-thought` approach.
- **Natively Multi-Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi-modal, they accept text, image, audio and video as input and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (**Agent Teams**) with reasoning, memory, and shared context.
- **Built-in Agentic Search**: Agents can search for information at runtime using 20+ vector databases. Agno provides state-of-the-art Agentic RAG, **fully async and highly performant.**
- **Built-in Memory & Session Storage**: Agents come with built-in `Storage` & `Memory` drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Pre-built FastAPI Routes**: After building your Agents, serve them using pre-built FastAPI routes. 0 to production in minutes.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
