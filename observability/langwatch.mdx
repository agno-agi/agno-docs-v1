## Integrating Agno with LangWatch

LangWatch provides seamless observability for Agno agents. By integrating Agno with LangWatch, you can automatically capture and send traces for monitoring and analysis—no manual OpenTelemetry setup required.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

   ```bash
   pip install agno openai langwatch openinference-instrumentation-agno
   ```

2. **Get Your LangWatch API Key**

   - Sign up or log in to your [LangWatch dashboard](https://app.langwatch.ai/).
   - Obtain your API key from your project settings.

3. **Set Environment Variable**

   Configure your environment with the LangWatch API key:

   ```bash
   export LANGWATCH_API_KEY=your-langwatch-api-key
   ```

## Installing Required Packages

To get started, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install agno openai langwatch openinference-instrumentation-agno
```

## Sending Traces to LangWatch

This example demonstrates how to instrument your Agno agent and send traces to LangWatch using the official Python SDK:

```python
import langwatch
import os

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from openinference.instrumentation.agno import AgnoInstrumentor

# Initialize LangWatch and instrument Agno
langwatch.setup(
    instrumentors=[AgnoInstrumentor()]
)

# Create and configure your Agno agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Stock Price Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools()],
    instructions="You are a stock price agent. Answer questions in the style of a stock analyst.",
    debug_mode=True,
)

# Use the agent as usual—traces will be sent to LangWatch
tag_response = agent.print_response("What is the current price of Tesla?")
```

## Notes

- **No OpenTelemetry Setup Needed**: You do **not** need to set any OpenTelemetry environment variables or configure exporters manually—`langwatch.setup()` handles everything.
- **Combine Instrumentors**: You can combine Agno instrumentation with other instrumentors (e.g., OpenAI, LangChain) by adding them to the `instrumentors` list.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you see no traces in LangWatch, ensure your `LANGWATCH_API_KEY` is set and that the instrumentor is included in `langwatch.setup()`.
- For advanced configuration (custom attributes, endpoint, etc.), see the [LangWatch Python integration guide](https://docs.langwatch.ai/integration/python/integrations/agno).

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate Agno with LangWatch, enabling comprehensive observability and monitoring of your AI agents.
