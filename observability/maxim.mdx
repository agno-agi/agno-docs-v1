## Integrating Agno with Maxim

Maxim AI provides comprehensive agent monitoring, evaluation, and observability for your Agno applications. With Maxim's one-line integration, you can easily trace and analyse agent interactions, performance metrics, and more.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

   ```bash
   pip install agno openai maxim-py
   ```

2. **Setup Maxim Account**

   - Sign up for an account at [Maxim](https://getmaxim.ai/).
   - Generate your API key from the Maxim dashboard.
   - Create a repository to store your traces.

3. **Set Environment Variables**

   Configure your environment with the Maxim API key:

   ```bash
   export MAXIM_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   export MAXIM_LOG_REPO_ID=<your-repo-id>
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   ```

## Sending Traces to Maxim

### Example: Basic Maxim Integration

This example demonstrates how to instrument your Agno agent with Maxim and send traces for monitoring and evaluation.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from maxim import Maxim
from maxim.logger.agno import instrument_agno

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Instrument Agno with Maxim
instrument_agno(Maxim().logger())

# Create and configure the agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Stock Price Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools()],
    instructions="You are a stock price agent. Answer questions in the style of a stock analyst.",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# Use the agent
response = agent.run("What is the current price of Tesla?")
print(response.content)
```

### Example: Multi-Agent System with Maxim

This example demonstrates how to set up a multi-agent system with comprehensive Maxim tracing.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.googlesearch import GoogleSearchTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from maxim import Maxim
from maxim.logger.agno import instrument_agno

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Instrument Agno with Maxim
instrument_agno(Maxim().logger())

# Create individual agents
web_search_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    role="Search the web for information",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[GoogleSearchTools()],
    instructions="Always include sources",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Get financial data",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data",
    markdown=True,
)

# Create multi-agent system
multi_ai_agent = Agent(
    team=[web_search_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="You are a helpful financial assistant. Answer user questions about stocks, companies, and financial data.",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

# Use the multi-agent system
response = multi_ai_agent.run("What's the current stock price of Apple and what are the latest analyst recommendations?")
print(response.content)
```

## Features

### Observability & Tracing

Maxim provides comprehensive observability for your Agno agents:

- **Agent Tracing**: Track your agent's complete lifecycle, including tool calls, agent trajectories, and decision flows
- **Token Usage**: Monitor prompt and completion token consumption
- **Model Information**: Track which models are being used and their performance
- **Tool Calls**: Detailed logging of all tool executions and their results
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, cost, and error rate tracking

### Evaluation & Analytics

- **Auto Evaluations**: Automatically evaluate captured logs based on filters and sampling
- **Human Evaluations**: Use human evaluation or rating to assess log quality
- **Node Level Evaluations**: Evaluate any component of your trace for detailed insights
- **Dashboards**: Visualize traces over time, usage metrics, latency & error rates

### Alerting

Set thresholds on error rates, cost, token usage, user feedback, and latency to get real-time alerts via Slack or PagerDuty.

## Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your environment variables are correctly set for the API key and repository ID.
- **Instrumentation Order**: Call `instrument_agno()` **before** creating or executing any agents to ensure proper tracing.
- **Debug Mode**: Enable debug mode to see detailed logging information:

  ```python
  instrument_agno(Maxim().logger(), {"debug" : True})
  ```
- **Maxim Docs**: For more information on Maxim's features and capabilities, refer to the [Maxim documentation](https://getmaxim.ai/docs).

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate Agno with Maxim, enabling comprehensive observability, evaluation, and monitoring of your AI agents.
