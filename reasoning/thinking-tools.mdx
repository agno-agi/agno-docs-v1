The `ThinkingTools` toolkit provides Agents with a dedicated space for reflection during execution. This toolkit enables an Agent to use a scratchpad for thinking through problems, listing rules, checking information, verifying compliance, and evaluating results before taking actions.

When combined with domain-specific tools like `YFinanceTools`, Agents can perform complex analysis and produce well-reasoned reports by first gathering information and then thinking through their approach before delivering the final output.


## Example

Here's an example of how to use `ThinkingTools` for financial analysis:

```python claude_thinking_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.thinking import ThinkingTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
    tools=[
        ThinkingTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(
            stock_price=True,
            analyst_recommendations=True,
            company_info=True,
            company_news=True,
        ),
    ],
    instructions="Use tables where possible",
    markdown=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reasoning_agent.print_response(
        "Write a report on NVDA. Only the report, no other text.",
        stream=True,
        show_full_reasoning=True,
        stream_intermediate_steps=True,
    )
```
