description: Learn how to run a team and get the response.
---

The `Team.run()` function runs the team and generates a response, either as a `TeamRunResponse` object or a stream of `TeamRunResponse` objects.

Many of our examples use `team.print_response()` which is a helper utility to print the response in the terminal. It uses `team.run()` under the hood.

Here's how to run your team. The response is captured in the `response` and `response_stream` variables.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent_1 = Agent(name="News Agent", role="Get the latest news")

agent_2 = Agent(name="Weather Agent", role="Get the weather for the next 7 days")

team = Team(name="News and Weather Team", mode="coordinate", members=[agent_1, agent_2])

response = team.run("What is the weather in Tokyo?")

# Synchronous execution
result = team.run("What is the weather in Tokyo?")

# Asynchronous execution
result = await team.arun("What is the weather in Tokyo?")

# Streaming responses
for chunk in team.run("What is the weather in Tokyo?", stream=True):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)

# Asynchronous streaming
async for chunk in await team.arun("What is the weather in Tokyo?", stream=True):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```


## Streaming Intermediate Steps

Throughout the execution of a team, multiple events take place, and we provide these events in real-time for enhanced team transparency.

You can enable streaming of intermediate steps by setting `stream_intermediate_steps=True`.

```python
# Stream with intermediate steps
response_stream = team.run(
    "What is the weather in Tokyo?",
    stream=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True
)
```

### Event Types

The following events are sent by the `Team.run()` and `Team.arun()` functions depending on team's configuration:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `RunStarted` | Indicates the start of a run |
| `RunResponse` | Contains the model's response text as individual chunks |
| `RunCompleted` | Signals successful completion of the run |
| `RunError` | Indicates an error occurred during the run |
| `RunCancelled` | Signals that the run was cancelled |
| `ToolCallStarted` | Indicates the start of a tool call |
| `ToolCallCompleted` | Signals completion of a tool call. This also contains the tool call results. |
| `ReasoningStarted` | Indicates the start of the agent's reasoning process |
| `ReasoningStep` | Contains a single step in the reasoning process |
| `ReasoningCompleted` | Signals completion of the reasoning process |
| `UpdatingMemory` | Indicates that the agent is updating its memory |
| `WorkflowStarted` | Indicates the start of a workflow |
| `WorkflowCompleted` | Signals completion of a workflow |
