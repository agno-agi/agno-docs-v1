**Agents use storage to save sessions in a database.**

Agents come with built-in memory but it only lasts while the session is active.

To persist session history and state across runs, we can provide `AgentStorage` which saves an Agent's session to a database or file. Storage has typically been an under-discussed part of agentic infrastructure, but we see it as one of the most critical pieces of the stack.

While storage is absolutely necessary when building user facing AI products as any production application will need to be able to retrieve sessions, continue sessions, and save state between runs. There is so much more:
- Storage saves our Agent's session data for inspection and evaluations.
- Storage helps us extract few-shot examples from session data, which can be used to improve the Agent.
- Storage enables us to build internal monitoring tools and dashboards.

## Agent Storage

When working with agents, storage allows users to continue conversations where they left off. Every message, along with the agent's responses, is saved to your database of choice.

Here's a simple example of adding storage to an agent:

```python storage.py
"""Run `pip install duckduckgo-search sqlalchemy openai` to install dependencies."""

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.storage.sqlite import SqliteStorage
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    storage=SqliteStorage(
        table_name="agent_sessions", db_file="tmp/data.db", auto_upgrade_schema=True
    ),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    add_history_to_messages=True,
    add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
)
agent.print_response("How many people live in Canada?")
agent.print_response("What is their national anthem?")
agent.print_response("List my messages one by one")
```

## Team Storage

`Storage` drivers also works with teams, providing persistent memory and state management for multi-agent collaborative systems. With team storage, you can maintain conversation history, shared context, and team state across multiple sessions.

## Workflow Storage

The storage system in Agno also works with workflows, enabling more complex multi-agent systems with state management. This allows for persistent conversations and cached results across workflow sessions.

## Supported Storage Backends

The following databases are supported as a storage backend:

- [PostgreSQL](/storage/postgres)
- [Sqlite](/storage/sqlite)
- [SingleStore](/storage/singlestore)
- [DynamoDB](/storage/dynamodb)
- [MongoDB](/storage/mongodb)
- [YAML](/storage/yaml)
- [JSON](/storage/json)
- [Redis](/storage/redis)
