This guide provides instructions for integrating Agno AI with the [Truefoundry AI Gateway](https://www.truefoundry.com/ai-gateway).

## What is TrueFoundry AI Gateway?

TrueFoundry provides an enterprise-ready [AI Gateway](https://www.truefoundry.com/ai-gateway) which can integrate with agentic frameworks like Agno AI and provides governance and observability for your AI Applications.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Agno AI with TrueFoundry, ensure you have:

1. **TrueFoundry Account**: Create a [Truefoundry account](https://www.truefoundry.com/register) and follow the instructions in our [Gateway Quick Start Guide](https://docs.truefoundry.com/gateway/quick-start)
2. **Agno Installation**: In your project directory, install Agno using pip: `pip install agno`        #See [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/agno/1.1.6/) for latest updates

## Setup Process

### 1. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

Set up your environment variables to connect Agno with TrueFoundry Gateway:

```bash
export API_KEY="your-truefoundry-api-key"
export BASE_URL="your-truefoundry-gateway-url"
```

You will get your 'truefoundry-api-key', 'truefoundry-gateway-url' and model name directly from the unified code snippet

### 2. Configure Agno Agents

Create your Agno agents with TrueFoundry Gateway configuration:


```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Configure agent with TrueFoundry Gateway
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(
        id="openai-main/gpt-4o",    # Use TrueFoundry model name. Similarly you can call any model from any model provider like anthropic, gemini etc
        api_key="your-truefoundry-api-key",
        base_url="your-truefoundry-gateway-url"
    ),
    description="AI assistant powered by TrueFoundry Gateway",
    instructions=[
        "You are a helpful AI assistant",
        "Provide accurate and concise responses"
    ]
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Single Agent

Create a simple agent using the configured TrueFoundry Gateway:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Single agent with TrueFoundry Gateway
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(
        id="openai-main/gpt-4o",
        api_key="your-truefoundry-api-key",
        base_url="your-truefoundry-gateway-url"
        ),
    name="Assistant",
    description="General purpose AI assistant"
)

# Run the agent
response = agent.run("What is the capital of Brazil?")
print(response.content)
```

### Multi-Agent Team

Create a team of specialized agents for complex tasks:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.team import Team
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Research Agent
researcher = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(
        id="openai-main/gpt-4o",
        api_key="your-truefoundry-api-key",
        base_url="your-truefoundry-gateway-url"
        ),
    name="Researcher",
    description="Conducts thorough research on topics",
    instructions=[
        "Research the given topic thoroughly",
        "Provide factual and well-sourced information"
    ]
)

# Writer Agent
writer = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(
        id="openai-main/gpt-4o",
        api_key="your-truefoundry-api-key",
        base_url="your-truefoundry-gateway-url"
        ),
    name="Writer",
    description="Creates well-structured content",
    instructions=[
        "Write clear and engaging content",
        "Structure information logically"
    ]
)

# Create team
research_team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    instructions=[
        "Researcher should investigate the topic first",
        "Writer should create content based on research findings"
    ]
)

# Execute team task
result = research_team.run("Research and write about sustainable energy solutions")
```


## Benefits of Using TrueFoundry Gateway with Agno AI
