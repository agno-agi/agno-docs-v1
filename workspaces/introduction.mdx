sidebarTitle: Introduction

**Workspaces** are standardized codebases for running Agentic Systems locally using Docker and in production on AWS. They contain:

- A RestAPI (FastAPI) to serving Agents, Teams and Workflows.
- A streamlit application for debugging and testing. This streamlit app is very versatile and is used as an admin interface for the agentic system.
- A postgres database for session and vector storage.

The codebases are setup to run locally using docker and can be deployed to AWS with 1 command. They're a fantastic starting point and exactly what we ourselves use for our customers. Years of learning available for free for the open-source community.

## Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using: `ag ws create`
- Run locally using docker: `ag ws up`
- Run in production on AWS: `ag ws up prd:aws`

We recommend starting with the `agent-app` template and taking it from there.

# How we build Agentic Systems

When building Agents, we start locally and iterate till we achieve 6/10 quality.
This helps us see quick results and get a rough idea of how our solution should look like in production.

Then, we start moving to a production environment and iterate from there. Here's how __*we*__ build production systems:
- Serve Agents, Teams and Workflows via a RestAPI (FastAPI).
- Use a streamlit application for debugging and testing. This streamlit app is generally used as an admin interface for the agentic system and shows all sorts of data.llll
- Monitor, evaluate and improve till we reach 9/10 quality.
- In parallel, we start integrating our front-end with the Rest API above.

Having built 100s of such systems, we have a standard set of codebases we use and we call them **Workspaces**. They help us manage our Agentic System as code.
