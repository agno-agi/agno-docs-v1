## Custom Functions for Workflows

### Overview
Custom functions provide flexibility by allowing developers to define specific logic for task execution. They can be used to `preprocess inputs`, `call agents`, and `postprocess outputs`.

### How Custom Functions Work
- **Execution Function**: Tasks can be defined with a custom execution function that handles the task logic.
- **Integration with Agents and Teams**: Custom functions can interact with agents and teams, leveraging their capabilities.

While defining a `Task`, you can specify a custom function as an `execution_function`. This function should accept a `TaskInput` object and return a `TaskOutput` object.

```python
task = Task(
    name="custom_analysis",
    execution_function=custom_blog_analysis_function,  # Custom function with agent
    description="Custom blog analysis with preprocessing and postprocessing",
)

def custom_blog_analysis_function(task_input: TaskInput) -> TaskOutput:
    """
    Custom function that does preprocessing, calls an agent, and does postprocessing
    """
    query = task_input.get_primary_input()

    # Custom preprocessing
    print(f"🔍 Starting custom blog analysis for: {query}")

    # Add custom context and formatting
    enhanced_query = f"""
        BLOG ANALYSIS REQUEST:
        Topic: {query}
        
        Please provide:
        1. Key themes and trends
        2. Target audience insights  
        3. Content opportunities
        4. SEO considerations
        
        Additional context from previous tasks:
        {task_input.previous_outputs if task_input.previous_outputs else "No previous context"}
    """

    # Call the agent with enhanced input
    try:
        response = blog_analyzer.run(enhanced_query)

        # Custom postprocessing
        enhanced_content = f"""
            ## Custom Blog Analysis Results

            **Original Query:** {query}

            **Analysis:**
            {response.content}

            **Custom Insights:**
            - Analysis completed with enhanced context
            - Ready for next stage processing
            - Confidence level: High
        """.strip()

        # Return TaskOutput with enhanced response
        return TaskOutput(
            content=enhanced_content,
            response=response,
            data={"analysis_type": "custom", "confidence": "high"},
            metadata={
                "function_name": "custom_blog_analysis_function",
                "preprocessing": True,
                "postprocessing": True,
            },
        )

    except Exception as e:
        return TaskOutput(
            content=f"Custom blog analysis failed: {str(e)}",
            metadata={"error": True, "function_name": "custom_blog_analysis_function"},
        )
```

Just make sure to follow this structure and return the output as a `TaskOutput` object.

```python
def custom_blog_analysis_function(task_input: TaskInput) -> TaskOutput:
    # Custom preprocessing
    # Call the agent
    # Custom postprocessing
    return TaskOutput(content=enhanced_content)
```

## Streaming
Streaming in workflows allows for real-time updates and feedback during task execution. This is particularly useful for long-running tasks or when immediate feedback is required.
- **Event-Driven Execution**: Tasks can yield events during execution, providing updates on progress or intermediate results.

To use streaming with workflows just set the `stream` and `stream_intermediate_steps` parameter to `True` in the `run` or `print_response` methods of the `Workflow` class.

```python
workflow.print_response(
    message="AI trends in 2024",
    markdown=True,
    stream=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True,
)
```

Check the full example cookbook [here](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/main/cookbook/workflows/basic_stream_pipeline_workflow.py)

## Custom Streaming Functions
Custom functions can also support streaming by yielding events during execution. While performing `.run` or `.arun` in your custom execution function, you can `yield` events to provide real-time updates. 

Something like this-
```python
 # Stream the agent response
for event in blog_analyzer.run(
        enhanced_query, stream=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True
    ):
    yield event
    if hasattr(event, "content") and event.content:
        accumulated_content += event.content
```

This is demonstrated in the cookbook [here](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/main/cookbook/workflows/basic_stream_custom_execution_function_workflow.py)

## Asynchronous Execution
Asynchronous workflows allow tasks to be executed concurrently, improving efficiency and responsiveness, especially in I/O-bound operations.

To enable asynchronous execution, you can use the `async` keyword in your task definitions and run the workflow using `await`.

See a detailed example in the cookbook [here](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/main/cookbook/workflows/async_basic_pipeline_workflow.py)


## Pydantic Input
Pydantic is used for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. It ensures that inputs to tasks are structured and validated.
- **Data Models**: Define structured data models using Pydantic's BaseModel.
- **Validation**: Automatically validate input data against the defined models.

To use a Pydantic model as input you can define it and put it as the `message_data` parameter in the `print_response`/`run` method of the `Workflow` class.

```python
class ResearchTopic(BaseModel):
    focus_areas: List[str] = Field(description="Specific areas to focus on")
    target_audience: str = Field(description="Who this research is for")
    sources_required: int = Field(description="Number of sources needed", default=5)

research_topic = ResearchTopic(
    focus_areas=["Machine Learning", "NLP", "Computer Vision", "AI Ethics"],
    target_audience="Tech professionals and business leaders",
    sources_required=8,
)

workflow.print_response(
    message="AI trends in 2024",
    message_data=research_topic,
    markdown=True,
)
```
