---

This example demonstrates **Workflows 2.0** using the Steps object to organize multiple 
individual steps into logical sequences. This pattern allows you to define reusable step 
sequences and choose which sequences to execute in your workflow.

**When to use**: When you have logical groupings of steps that you want to organize, reuse,
or selectively execute. Ideal for creating modular workflow components that can be mixed
and matched based on different scenarios.

```python workflow_using_steps.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.workflow.v2.step import Step
from agno.workflow.v2.steps import Steps
from agno.workflow.v2.workflow import Workflow

# Define agents for different tasks
researcher = Agent(
    name="Research Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions="Research the given topic and provide key facts and insights.",
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writing Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="Write a comprehensive article based on the research provided. Make it engaging and well-structured.",
)

editor = Agent(
    name="Editor Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="Review and edit the article for clarity, grammar, and flow. Provide a polished final version.",
)

# Define individual steps
research_step = Step(
    name="research",
    agent=researcher,
    description="Research the topic and gather information",
)

writing_step = Step(
    name="writing",
    agent=writer,
    description="Write an article based on the research",
)

editing_step = Step(
    name="editing",
    agent=editor,
    description="Edit and polish the article",
)

# Create a Steps sequence that chains these above steps together
article_creation_sequence = Steps(
    name="article_creation",
    description="Complete article creation workflow from research to final edit",
    steps=[research_step, writing_step, editing_step],
)

# Create and use workflow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    article_workflow = Workflow(
        name="Article Creation Workflow",
        description="Automated article creation from research to publication",
        steps=[article_creation_sequence],
    )

    article_workflow.print_response(
        message="Write an article about the benefits of renewable energy",
        markdown=True,
    )
```
