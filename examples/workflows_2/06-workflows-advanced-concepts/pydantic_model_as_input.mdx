title: Pydantic Model as Input
description: Demonstrates **Workflows 2.0** using Pydantic models as structured input to workflows.
---

This example demonstrates how to use Pydantic models as structured input to workflows.

This is particularly useful when you need to:
- Validate input parameters before workflow execution
- Ensure consistent data structure across different workflow runs and have type safety
- Provide clear documentation of expected input format
- Handle complex input requirements with multiple fields
- Create reusable input models for different workflow scenarios
