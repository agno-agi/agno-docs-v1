title: Conditional Branching Workflow
description: This example demonstrates **Workflows 2.0** router pattern for intelligent, content-based workflow routing.
---

This example demonstrates **Workflows 2.0** to dynamically select the best execution path based on input 
analysis, enabling adaptive workflows that choose optimal strategies per topic.

**When to use**: When you need mutually exclusive execution paths based on business logic.
Ideal for topic-specific workflows, expertise routing, or when different subjects require 
completely different processing strategies. Unlike Conditions which can trigger multiple 
parallel paths, Router selects exactly one path.
