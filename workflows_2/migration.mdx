## Migrating from Workflows 1.0

Workflows 2.0 is a completely new approach to agent automation, and requires an upgrade from the Workflows 1.0 implementation. It introduces a new, more flexible and powerful way to build workflows.

### Key Differences

| Workflows 1.0 | Workflows 2.0 | Migration Path |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Linear only | Multiple patterns | Add Parallel/Condition as needed |
| Agent-focused | Mixed components | Convert functions to Steps |
| Limited branching | Smart routing | Replace if/else with Router |
| Manual loops | Built-in Loop | Use Loop component |

### Migration Steps

1. **Assess current workflow**: Identify parallel opportunities
2. **Add conditions**: Convert if/else logic to Condition components
3. **Extract functions**: Move custom logic to function-based steps
4. **Enable streaming**: For event-based information
5. **Add state management**: Use `workflow_session_state` for data sharing

For more examples and advanced patterns, explore the [`cookbook/workflows/sync/`](/cookbook/workflows_2/sync) and [`cookbook/workflows/async/`](/cookbook/workflows_2/async) directory. Each file demonstrates a specific pattern with detailed comments and real-world use cases.
