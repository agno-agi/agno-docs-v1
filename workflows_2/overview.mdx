Agno Workflows are designed to automate complex processes by defining a series of steps that are executed in sequence. Each step can be executed by an agent, a team, or a custom function.

## Why would you use Workflows?

Workflows are a great way to automate complex processes by defining a series of steps that are executed in sequence. They are particularly useful when you need to:

- Automate a series of tasks
- Orchestrate a series of agents and teams
- Have complex logic where you require agents to run in loops, or in parallel, or route different flows based on the output of previous steps

When building multi-agent systems, there is often a need to control the flow of execution, and this is where Workflows come in. Workflows are best suited for deterministic agent automation, as opposed to [Teams](/teams) which are made for agentic coordination between agents.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Step-Wise Controlled Execution
Agno Workflows are fundamentally an execution of a series of steps. These steps are executed in sequence, and the output of each step is passed to the next step.

Each step can be executed by an agent, a team, or a custom Python function. These are individual components that can work independently but gain enhanced capabilities when orchestrated together:
- **Agents**: Individual AI executors with specific capabilities and instructions
- **Teams**: Coordinated groups of agents working together on complex problems
- **Functions**: Custom Python functions for specialized processing logic

The beauty of this approach is that you have access to the full power of Agno Agents and Teams, with the flexibility of a sophisticated orchestration system. Your agents and teams retain their individual characteristics, memory, and behavior patterns, but now operate within a structured workflow that provides:
- Sequential step execution with output chaining
- Session management and state persistence
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Streaming capabilities for real-time feedback


### Architectural components
1. The **`Workflow`** class is the top-level orchestrator that manages the entire execution process.
2. **`Step`** is the fundamental unit of work in the workflow system. Each step encapsulates exactly one `executor` - either an `Agent`, a `Team`, or a custom Python function. This design ensures clarity and maintainability while preserving the individual characteristics of each executor.
3. **`Loop`** is a construct that allows you to execute one or more steps multiple times. This is useful when you need to repeat a set of steps until a certain condition is met.
4. **`Parallel`** is a construct that allows you to execute one or more steps in parallel. This is useful when you need to execute a set of steps concurrently with the outputs joined together.
5. **`Condition`** makes a step conditional based on criteria you specify.
6. **`Router`** allows you to specify which step(s) to execute next, effectively creating branching logic in your workflow.

<Note>
When using a custom Python function as an executor for a step, `StepInput` and `StepOutput` provides standardized interfaces for data flow between steps:

### How to make your first workflow?

Lets set up a series of steps that utilize agents and teams to automate content creation based on tech trends from Hackernews.
It involves two main steps: 
- researching tech topics
- planning content. 

These steps are passed as a list to the `Workflow` class, which orchestrates their execution, which we refer to as a particular pipeline of a workflow.

```python basic_hackernews_workflow.py
"""
This example shows a basic sequential pipeline of steps that run agents and teams.

It is for a content writer that creates posts about tech trends from Hackernews.
